10 You know what I got for Christmas this year? Stress from shopping around for the presents. Backache from decorating the house with Christmas lights. And soon 20 pounds from eating all the yummy Christmas food! Seriously though It's a wonderful time to spends it with great friends and family like you :) Merry Christmas.
